= Adding an SSH key to a project by using the web console

You can add a _static_ public SSH key to a project by using the {product-title} web console. Afterwards, this key is added to the virtual machines (VMs) that you create in the project.

A static public key is added to a VM at startup as cloud-init metadata. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.

.Prerequisites

* You generated an SSH key pair by running the `ssh-keygen` command.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *Overview* in the web console.
. On the *Settings* tab, click the *User* tab.
. Expand *Manage SSH keys*.
. Select a project from the *Project* list and click the edit icon.
. Select an SSH key option:

* *Use existing*: Select a secret from the secrets list.
* *Add new*:
.. Browse to the public SSH key file or paste the file in the key field.
.. Enter the secret name.

. Click *Save*.

.Verification
. Create a VM in the same project as the SSH key.
. Click the VM to view the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. Click the *Scripts* tab on the *Configuration* tab.

The secret name is displayed in the *Authorized SSH key* section.

= Cluster autoscaling settings using OpenShift Cluster Manager

The tables explain all the configurable UI settings when using cluster autoscaling with OpenShift Cluster Manager.

== Balancing behavior

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`balanceSimilarNodeGroups`
|If `true`, this setting automatically identifies node groups with the same instance type and the same set of labels and tries to keep the respective sizes of those node groups balanced.
|`boolean`
|false

|`logVerbosity`
|Sets the autoscaler log level. Default value is 1, level 4 is recommended for debugging and level 6 enables almost everything.
|`integer`
|1

|`maxPodGracePeriod`
|Gives pods graceful termination time before scaling down.
|`integer`
|600

|`skipNodesWithLocalStorage`
|If `true`, the cluster autoscaler never deletes nodes with pods with local storage, e.g. EmptyDir or HostPath.
|`boolean`
|true
|===

== Resource limits

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`maxNodesTotal`
|Maximum number of nodes in all node groups. Includes all nodes, not just automatically scaled nodes. The cluster autoscaler does not grow the cluster beyond this number.
|`integer`
|0

|`cores.min`
|Minimum number of cores in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster beyond these numbers.
|`object`
|1

|`cores.max`
|Maximum number of cores in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster beyond these numbers.
|`object`
|320000

|`memory.min`
|Minimum number of gigabytes of memory in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster beyond these numbers.
|`object`
|1

|`memory.max`
|Maximum number of gigabytes of memory in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster beyond these numbers.
|`object`
|6400000
|===

== Scale down configuration

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`enable`
|Should the cluster autoscaler scale down the cluster.
|`boolean`
|`true`

|`scaleDown.unneededTime`
|How long a node should be unneeded before it is eligible for scale down.
|`string`
|10m

|`scaleDown.utilizationThreshold`
|Node utilization level, defined as sum of requested resources divided by capacity, below which a node can be considered for scale down.
|`string`
|0.5

|`scaleDown.delayAfterAdd`
|How long after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|10m

|`scaleDown.delayAfterDelete`
|How long after node deletion that scale down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|0s

|`scaleDown.delayAfterFailure`
|How long after scale down failure that scale down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|3m

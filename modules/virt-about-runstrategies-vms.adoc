= About run strategies for virtual machines

Run strategies for virtual machines (VMs) determine how virtual machine instances (VMIs) behave under certain conditions.

You configure a run strategy by assigning a value to the `runStrategy` key in the `VirtualMachine` manifest as in the following example:

.Example run strategy
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
# ...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `runStrategy` and the `running` keys are mutually exclusive. Only one of them can be used.
====

The `runStrategy` key gives you more flexibility because it has four values, unlike the `running` key, which has a Boolean value.

.`runStrategy` key values

`Always`::
The VMI is always present when a virtual machine is created. A new VMI is created if the original stops for any reason. This is the same behavior as `running: true`.

`RerunOnFailure`::
The VMI is re-created if the previous instance fails. The instance is not re-created if the virtual machine stops successfully, such as when it is shut down.

`Manual`::
You control the VMI state manually with the `start`, `stop`, and `restart` virtctl client commands.

`Halted`::
No VMI is present when a virtual machine is created. This is the same behavior as `running: false`.

Different combinations of the `start`, `stop` and `restart` virtctl commands affect the run strategy.

The following table describes a VM's transition from different states. The first column shows the VM's initial run strategy. The remaining columns show a virtctl command and the new run strategy after that command is run.

[NOTE]
====
If a node in a cluster installed by using installer-provisioned infrastructure fails the machine health check and is unavailable, VMs with `runStrategy: Always` or `runStrategy: RerunOnFailure` are rescheduled on a new node.

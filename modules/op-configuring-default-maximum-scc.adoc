= Configuring the default and maximum SCC for pods that {pipelines-shortname} creates

You can configure the default security context constraint (SCC) for all pods that {pipelines-shortname} creates for task runs and pipeline runs. You can also configure the maximum SCC, which is the least restrictive SCC that can be configured for these pods in any namespace.

.Procedure

* Edit the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR) by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit TektonConfig config
----
+
Set the default and maximum SCC in the spec, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
#  ...
  platforms:
    openshift:
      scc:
        default: "restricted-v2" # <1>
        maxAllowed: "privileged" # <2>
----
<1> `spec.platforms.openshift.scc.default` specifies the default SCC that {pipelines-shortname} attaches to the service account (SA) used for workloads, which is, by default, the `pipeline` SA. This SCC is used for all pipeline run and task run pods.
<2> `spec.platforms.openshift.scc.maxAllowed` specifies the least restrictive SCC that you can configure for pipeline run and task run pods in any namespace. This setting does not apply when you configure a custom SA and SCC in a particular pipeline run or task run.
